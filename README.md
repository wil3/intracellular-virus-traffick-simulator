Introduction
============

In order for a virus to reproduce it must utilize the cellular synthesis mechanisms. Some viruses need to enter the nucleus for replication. The pathway to the nucleus involves binding to the cell surface, entering the cell by endosome encapsulation, escaping into the cytosol, attachment to microtubule and finally reaching the nucleus. Most in vitro experiments study virus trafficking from cancer cells as they are easier to multiple and do not have an expiration date. However these cancer cells have mutations that are not seen in normal healthy cells such as multiple sudo microtubule organization centers (MTOCs). To understand the intracellular trafficking of virus under different environmental conditions a simulation model with a graphical interface has been developed. The simulator is capable of modelling single and multiple MTOCs, configurable number of viruses and microtubules and customized cell morphologies.
